This game is very hard.

An interesting tower defense game where you should direct the energy to the runes.

You control a turtle that shoots mustaches.
To fire you gotta energize "runes" by touching the bottom screen.
With Mech and Mirror rune, one should automate the energizing process. 
The more runes get energized the more you deal damage so you have to align runes to have maximum efficiency.

# TODO
- Turtle fire mechanism
- Game clock indicator
- Score system
- Restart system
